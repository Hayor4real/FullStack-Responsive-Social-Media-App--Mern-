This is responsive fullstack social media application 
using MERN from complete scratch this application will
consist of a register page with complete validation along
with functionality to upload a user image for our profile 
we can register and we can then use what we register to 
sign in and we can enter our home page and on our home page
we have a very clean looking website that we can have a number
of different widgets we have the user information everything  
about our current user thats signed in we are able to make posts
as well as add an image for the post we can edit delete and actually
make the post and we can see the posts that we have created and 
we can also see the users news feed of all the posts that have been
created from there then we can also actually like and dislike any 
posts that we want we can view the comments as well and from there for
each post we can add a friend if we would like and the friend list will
be updated we can add any amount of friends and we can remove them also 
and then we can to any of the users that we see 
we can change from light mode to dark mode
Everything is completely fully responsive we can see the same website on smaller 
screen

All the imformation is all coming from backend apis that we create from scratch
which are retrieving information from the mongo databases that we also created
so everything from API calls for the information that we set the user interface
that we create everything is coming from data that we have added and completely
configured the technologies that i used where MERN STACK which is represented by 
mongodatabase express.js react and node and more specifically for the frontend
i used react for the frame work formic and yup for form and form validation  
Redux toolkit for our state management with Redux persist to store in local 
storage and react drop zone for image uploads for backend i used node.js
as our runtime express.js as our backend framework mongoose for managing our 
database json web token for authentication and multer for file uploading
